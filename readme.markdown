#Basic syntax generation
My Intro to Linguistics class had a section on syntax and I couldn't resist turning a lot of that simple theory into a quick program that could generate syntacticly correct language.

##Favorite sentences so far:
```
[['this', 'poopie'], ['liked', ['Daniella']]]
[['some', 'woman'], ['swallowed', ['the', 'cat']]]
[['the', 'cat'], ['ate', ['Allie']]]
[['the', 'dog'], ['devoured', ['the', 'cat']]]
[['Sarah'], ['gave', ['this', 'cat'], ['the', 'poopie']]]
```

##todo
* Propositionl phrases.
* Adverbs.
* Switch from nested arrays to tree structure to syntactical structure representation.
* Double Object Frame is dorked (ex: [['Allie'], ['sent', ['some', 'woman'], ['she']]]), may be impossible without semantics to fix this.
