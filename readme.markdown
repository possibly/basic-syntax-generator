#Basic syntax generation
My Intro to Linguistics class had a section on syntax and I couldn't resist turning a lot of that simple theory into a quick program that could generate syntacticly correct language.

##Favorite sentences so far:
```
the ball ate the ball
the cat gave some cat the ball
the ball gave the ball this cat
Tyler smelled the ball
```

##Usage
`python syntax.py <number> <tree>`

`number`: number of sentences to be generated.

`tree`: literally add the word 'tree' to see the generated syntax structure as a tuple.

Setting neither <number> nor <tree> results in just one sentence being generated.

##todo
* Propositionl phrases.
* Adverbs, adjectives
* Semantic model?
